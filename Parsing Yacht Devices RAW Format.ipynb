    "# Parsing Yacht Devices' RAW Format\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook contains notes and explanatory Python code for parsing Yacht Devices' RAW format\n",
    "\n",
    "### About Yacht Devices\n",
    "\n",
    "Yacht Devices, https://www.yachtd.com/, produces and sells a variety of electronic devices for boats. Notably for this context, it has several devices for connecting a personal computer to a NMEA 2000 network. For example, its YDNU-02 NMEA 2000 USB Gateway.\n",
    "\n",
    "The YDNU-02 supports multiple modes of data interchange between the NMEA 2000 network and the USB side of the bridge. However, Yacht Devices recommends RAW mode--a readable text format--for developers, \"because it is the easiest option.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### About this Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "Yacht Devices provides some guidance on parsing the RAW format but seems to assume an understanding of NMEA 2000 and access to the NMEA 2000 specification. The former which I lacked when I started this notebook; the latter which must be purchased from NMEA and cannot be disclosed if it is.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook was my attempt at explaining Yacht Devices' RAW format and NMEA 2000 more generally to myself. It is based on publicly available information from various sources, both primary and secondary. Notably, the CANboat project, which has built a series of tools for working with NMEA 2000 data and that has a collection of NMEA 2000 PGNs (Parameter Group Numbers) that have been reverse engineered. https://github.com/canboat/canboat.\n",
    "\n",
    "While this notebook is directed specifically at Yacht Devices' RAW format--it is the device I have at this time--I believe that the format is sufficiently close to generic NMEA 2000 that this notebook may be directionally informative for users of devices from other manufactures, e.g., Actisense."

    "## Overview of RAW Format\n",
    "As described by Yacht Devices, the RAW format messages have the following form:\n",
    "\n",
    "`hh:mm:ss.ddd D msgid b0 b1 b2 b3 b4 b5 b6 b7<CR><LF>`\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "  * hh:mm:sss.ddd — time of message transmission or reception, ddd are milliseconds;\n",
    "  * D — direction of the message (‘R’ — from NMEA 2000 to PC, ‘T’ — from PC to NMEA 2000);\n",
    "  * msgid — 29-bit message identifier in hexadecimal format (contains NMEA 2000 PGN and other fields);\n",
    "  * b0..b7 — message data bytes (from 1 to 8) in hexadecimal format;\n",
    "  * \\<CR>\\<LF> — end-of-line symbols (carriage return and line feed, decimal 13 and 10).\n",

    "\n",
    "  * __hh are 24 hours__ - self-explanatory\n",
    "  * __ddd is milliseconds__ - as indicated above, the ddd portion of the time stamp is in milliseconds, not tenths, hundredths, and thousandths as the decimal might suggest.\n",
    "  * __Time is UTC or from device start__ - if the device, e.g., YDNU-02, received the time from the NMEA 2000 network the time stamp is UTC; otherwise, the time stamp is the time from the device's start.\n",

    "Python's strftime function can be used to parse this timestamp."
